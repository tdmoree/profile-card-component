# The challenge

### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.**
- **Bonus: Instead of using the createdAt strings from the data.json file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.**
